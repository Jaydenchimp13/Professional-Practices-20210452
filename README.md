### Privacy Principals â€“ Jayden

During the development of many different IT systems including but not limited to; personal applications and websites, it is of utmost important to uphold the privacy of all parties involved. In light of possibly outdated laws, New Zealand recently updated its privacy policy to aid in the protection of our privacy (as of 30/02/20).

- [ ] add some checklist items
<!-- good start please add some checklist items for each principle -->

I have compiled 5 of the principles stated in the policy with an in depth explanation of how to comply with these principals and the direct effects of these principals so that during the creation of your system you can comply with the laws in place and use them as a Checklist

I have successfully complied with:
- [ ] Pupose of collection
- [ ] Storage and security of personal information
- [ ] Correction of personal information
- [ ] Limits on use of personal information
- [ ] Limits on disclosure of personal information



## **Purpose of collection of personal information:**

When making a system, it's important that you are transparent in your uses of a users personal information and that the purpose of collection is ethical and relevant in nature. As a developer, you should aim to harvest as little of a persons personal data as possible for a multitude of reasons (data leaks, unsafe use of data on purpose or on accident/human error, ETC)

### **Why do we need to collect people's personal data?**

Often data is collected for things beneficial to the user of your system or ethical use to help maintain your system. Examples of this include targeted avertisment via [cookies](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/) stored in your browser, storage of personal information for electronic purchases (like credit cards), or your interactions with the system. This is generally to make improvements to the system by finding mistakes in your experience (your interactions) and having the funding to improve the experience in the future (by using ads), or for the users benefit should they use the system again (like storing card information at checkout)

### **How do we ensure the users are comfortable with the use of their data?**

If you need to collect personal data from a user of your system, you need to make sure you have informative consent to do so from the owner of the data you are collecting (which is presumably the user or the parent/guardian of the user) so that the user knows where the information is going, what it's used for and are still okay with you using their data. Generally this is done by creating a written agreement that, prior to the use of your system, the user reads over and agrees to. To reiterate, a user generally wont be comfortable with this agreement unless your use of their data is ethical and relevant to the system you have created (or they didnt read what they signed), so try to phrase your agreement as clearly and honestly you can in a concise manner  

## **Storage and security of personal information:**

If you, as the developer, intend to store people's personal information, you must ensure that you have the necessary safeguards in place to avoid the loss, misuse, access to and disclosure of your clients personal information. If you are required to give this information to a third party, it's your responsibility to ensure that the information remains safe from unorthorized use or disclosure (within reason). 

### **How do we store data safely?**

It depends on what the data is used for, so I compiled a small checklist for pysical storage of the data and software that can help defend against people trying to gain access

- [ ] Physical storage is in a private location that only authorised people can get to. This means some kind of lock on the room/building it's in. If it's a central hub/large storage unit, a lock on the case would also be advisable
- [ ] be careful of people trying to pose as the owner of the data/somoene who has access to the data


- [ ] Make sure the personal data you are storing is encrypted so that decyphering the information becomes a very arduous/borderling impossible task without the means to decrypt them properly (which only you should have)
- [ ] Have appropriate software installed such as antivirus and other software that protect against malicious programs 
- [ ] If the storage is apart of a network, make sure the connected devices either don't have access and/or are also secure as to avoid creating a "weak link"
