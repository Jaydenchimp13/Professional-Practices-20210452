### Privacy Principals â€“ Jayden

During the development of many different IT systems including but not limited to; personal applications and websites, it is of utmost important to uphold the privacy of all parties involved. In light of possibly outdated laws, New Zealand recently updated its privacy policy to aid in the protection of our privacy (as of 30/02/20).

- [ ] add some checklist items
<!-- good start please add some checklist items for each principle -->

I have compiled 5 of the principles stated in the policy with an in depth explanation of how to comply with these principals and the direct effects of these principals so that during the creation of your system you can comply with the laws in place and use them as a Checklist

I have successfully complied with:
- [ ] Pupose of collection
- [ ] Storage and security of personal information
- [ ] Correction of personal information
- [ ] Limits on use of personal information
- [ ] Limits on disclosure of personal information



## **Purpose of collection of personal information:**

When making a system, it's important that you are transparent in your uses of a users personal information and that the purpose of collection is ethical and relevant in nature. As a developer, you should aim to harvest as little of a persons personal data as possible for a multitude of reasons (data leaks, unsafe use of data on purpose or on accident/human error, ETC)

### **Why do we need to collect people's personal data?**

Often data is collected for things beneficial to the user of your system or ethical use to help maintain your system. Examples of this include targeted avertisment via [cookies](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/) stored in your browser, storage of personal information for electronic purchases (like credit cards), or your interactions with the system. This is generally to make improvements to the system by finding mistakes in your experience (your interactions) and having the funding to improve the experience in the future (by using ads), or for the users benefit should they use the system again (like storing card information at checkout)

### **How do we ensure the users are comfortable with the use of their data?**

If you need to collect personal data from a user of your system, you need to make sure you have informative consent to do so from the owner of the data you are collecting (which is presumably the user or the parent/guardian of the user) so that the user knows where the information is going, what it's used for and are still okay with you using their data. Generally this is done by creating a written agreement that, prior to the use of your system, the user reads over and agrees to. To reiterate, a user generally wont be comfortable with this agreement unless your use of their data is ethical and relevant to the system you have created (or they didnt read what they signed), so try to phrase your agreement as clearly and honestly you can in a concise manner  

## **Storage and security of personal information:**

If you, as the developer, intend to store people's personal information, you must ensure that you have the necessary safeguards in place to avoid the loss, misuse, access to and disclosure of your clients personal information. If you are required to give this information to a third party, it's your responsibility to ensure that the information remains safe from unorthorized use or disclosure (within reason). 

### **How do we store data safely?**

It depends on what the data is used for, so I compiled a small checklist for pysical storage of the data and software that can help defend against people trying to gain access

- [ ] Physical storage is in a private location that only authorised people can get to. This means some kind of lock on the room/building it's in. If it's a central hub/large storage unit, a lock on the case would also be advisable
- [ ] be careful of people trying to pose as the owner of the data/somoene who has access to the data


- [ ] Make sure the personal data you are storing is encrypted so that decyphering the information becomes a very arduous/borderling impossible task without the means to decrypt them properly (which only you should have)
- [ ] Have appropriate software installed such as antivirus and other software that protect against malicious programs 
- [ ] If the storage is apart of a network, make sure the connected devices either don't have access and/or are also secure as to avoid creating a "weak link"

### **How can I trust a third party?**

In the case you need to give personal information to a third party for whatever reason, make sure your reason is justified under the first clause of the policy, that it's relevant and ethical. To stay in line with that, make sure the third party is trusted and owns the same amount of responsibility for the data that you do. Male sure that your agreement with the user is still upheld and that the third party can also uphold that agreement. Lastly, make sure you have physical proof of their commitment to safety so that in the unfortunate scenario where they misuse the data, it's "not your head" for lack of a better phrasing. 


## **Correction of personal information:**

Holders of personal information are required to update the information they hold at the request of the client. This means that if something about the client and thus the clients info changes (EG: they move houses, switch banks and have a different credit card number, new car and thus number plate, different email, ETC) you are legally obliged to change update the info. 

### **What if I am unable to correct their personal information?**

If, for whatever reason, you are unable to edit the information (personal reasons included), then it's up to you to make sure that everyone else that comes in contact with the information, including third parties, knows that the information is no longer up to date. You can do this by attatching a "statement of correction" made by the client onto their personal information so that it can be clearly seen by anyone who has access to this information

### **How do we ensure the users personal information is consistently up to date?**

Provided they have access to a virtual system to do so (such as a website), the most effective way of doing this is to use their personal information to keep up to date with their personal information (IE: knowing their location and using it to guess if they moved or something) however this is generally considered a shady practice and sometimes isnt doable. Instead, you can send an annual reminder for them to update their information where applicable or ask them to redo their personal information on your systems website

## **Limits on use of personal information:**

Personal information that is obtained in connection with one specific purpose is to only be used for this one specific purpose (as per the agreement). If however, you believe that it's reasonable to use the information in a way the client possibly didn't intend, you can still use the information if the client stays anonymous, if the client consents to this new use of the informantion, if the information is required for proof regarding the breaking of an important law or if the information helps prevent or lessen the impact of a serious threat.

### **How do I inform the client of a change in the usage?**

in a non-urgent situation, contacting the client with whatever means you have (phone, email, ETC) and waiting for a positive response before taking action is the best way to go about using their info while adhering to the law. However, in an urgent situation, use the information you have ASAP and worry about the possible repercussions later. If your reason is truly valid, you'll have nothing to worry about.

### **How do I keep the users identity anonymous?**

As long as the client's face, name, location, workplace and any other things that could lead you to find the client ar  redacted from the copy of info you hand out, then you have done a successful job

## **Limits on disclosure of personal information:**

This basically refers back to the "ethical and relevant" manner of the collection, but for the distribution of the info. Any third parties involved should only be given personal information if the party will use the information in a way that is ethical, relevant and beneficial to the client OR the personal information is availible to public access (EG: a criminal record). The only exceptions are the same as before. If you can keep the client completely anonymous or if there is an emergency/serious threat, information can be freely disclosed and consequences will be given according to the situation.

### **How do I know if a company I plan to share with is relevant/ethical**

For relevance, the company needs to be doing something for you with the information. Examples include things like creating an advertisment or using the information to create a data sheet that can aid in your business/system. For ethics, make sure you research the party you'll be collaborating with thoroughly, so that you can trust them
